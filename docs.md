# XRP Ledger Trading Data API

## Summary

The XRP Ledger's built-in Decentralized Exchange is a low cost, fast and one of the most efficient exchanges on the Blockchain.

The team behind Sologenic has created a DEX interface [Sologenic DEX](https://sologenic.org/) that utilizes this technology to allow for XRP, SOLO and any other XRPL issued currency to be traded on-chain fast and seamlessly.

When building Sologenic DEX, the team at Sologenic used `Ripple Data API v2` which has been recently deprecated (https://xrpl.org/data-api.html). In spite of this, the Sologenic core team has created a free API that can be used by anyone to pull processed trading data from the XRP Ledger.

This API is currently being used in the Sologenic DEX production environment and both Mainnet and Testnet are currently supported.
We plan to add additional endpoints in the future. If you have any suggestions please feel free let us know by sending an email to info@sologenic.org

- This API is currently in **_BETA_** mode and minor changes in further releases will be compatible. For breaking changes we will use a versioning system to make sure existing users are not affected.

### Environments

Mainnet API root URL: `https://api.sologenic.org`

Testnet API root URL: `https://api-testnet.sologenic.org`

### Rate limiting

Current Trading data API rate limit is 100 rpm per IP. If you need a higher limit please email info@sologenic.org to be whitelisted.

## API documentation

### OHLC

`GET api/v1/ohlc`

#### Params

- `symbol` _required_ - symbol for which OHLC should be returned. NOTE: `symbol` should be urlsafe encoded.
**NOTE: 
`base_currencycode`+`base_issuer`/`second_currencycode`+`second_issuer`
1) if currncycode = XRP, then you do not need issuer
2) you must change `+` and `/` to `%2B` and `%2F`
so you finaly symbol will: USD`%2B`rD9W7ULveavz8qBGM1R5jMgK2QKsEDPQVi`%2F`XRP

- `period` _required_ - one of `["1m","3m","5m","15m","30m","1h","3h","6h","12h","1d","3d","1w"]`
- `from` _required_ - unix timestamp of OHLC start
- `to` _required_ - unix timestamp of OHLC end
**NOTE: API work with UTC time. `start date = 1970/01/01`, time must be in seconds - `14.09.2022 11:30:15 = 1663155015 sec`
how to count: `(date - start_date).TotalSeconds`
**NOTE: API has limitation of 2000 points per request**

It means that you can request 2000 of 1m points (2000/60/24) ~1.3 days. Or 2000 of 1h points ~83.3 days etc.
